This project implements the New York Times Wordle game using Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML.

The correct word is fetched using an <a href="https://random-word-api.vercel.app/api?words=1&length=5" target="_blank">API</a>.

ðŸ“Œ Game logistics: 

  - There's one correct word grabbed randomly each round of game. 
  
  - The user can take up to six chances to guess the correct word.
  
  - Either success or fail or error messages would be displayed according to user's input.

âœ¨ Highlights (for a newcomer to Javascript like me):

  - The letters in cells are animated to be floating!

  - The guess word could be submitted by pressing 'Enter' key on the keyboard!
