                <p>&#128278 BHTM played at our wedding last week and they blew us away in every way possible! 
                    They are talented, fun, energetic, and kept the dance floor packed the entire 
                    night. BHTM was a delight to work with. They were extremely accommodating and 
                    made every effort to create an amazing experience for us all. Paul (the 
                    manager/guitar player) worked with us several months in advance to iron away 
                    every possible detail. He even stepped in to help (in a BIG way) with 
                    last-minute issues with the ceremony sound system! This band not only has a vast 
                    and impressive repertoire, but offered to LEARN new songs for us. And they knocked 
                    them out of the park! What a night! Thanks BHTM!! -- Jose R.</p>

                <p>&#128278 The band was an amazing addition to the wedding. They were enthusiastic, talented
                     and kept the dance floor packed throughout the night. They read the crowd and 
                     knew when to speed it up and slow it down to keep the night alive and fun! They 
                     were incredibly helpful in planning with us before the date to know what our 
                     vision was, the mood we were going for and particular songs that we wanted played. 
                     They also had great suggestions for songs I never would have thought of that 
                     were perfect for the wedding. They even offered to learn songs that may not 
                     have been on their play list and learned them well. Overall, the band really 
                     rocked and added energy and fun to an amazing weekend. I would recommend them 
                     to anyone looking for a wedding band that plays a wide breadth of music well, 
                     works with you to tailor the evening to your needs and reads a crowd to 
                     maximize everyone's enjoyment. -- Rachel and Mike L.</p>

                <p>&#128278 I'm so glad that I picked Better Her Than Me as my wedding band. They 
                    are professional and flexible, they took time to learn my first dance song 
                    and their performance blow out my mind. My first dance song needs to combine 
                    two songs together and they played it just the way I wanted and even better. 
                    Their music are great to dance to, all of my guests had such a good time and 
                    especially my dad. I would recommend Better Her Than Me to any couple or 
                    company if you're looking for a band for dance or just simply can give you 
                    a good time on your event. Your guests won't be disappointed, and they will 
                    definitely stand up and dance. -- Nan Q.</p>

                <p>&#128278 From the moment we stepped out onto the dance floor for our first 
                    dance until the final note of the closing song we and our guests couldn't 
                    stop dancing and smiling thanks to BHTM. Better Her Than Me turned planning 
                    the music for our event from a stressful experience into a dream. BHTM made 
                    it incredibly easy for us to share our thoughts on their song list to create 
                    the perfect musical score for our wedding. They were also incredibly flexible 
                    and were willing to learn new songs that we wished to hear at our wedding. 
                    They also gracefully accepted changes to the reception schedule, to the 
                    order of songs and helped out with last minute ceremony requests. -- Judith P.</p>

                <p>&#128278 A fantastic band! We hired BHTM for a 60th birthday party. Terrific 
                    performers! I would hire them again - and again. The guest can't stop 
                    talking about them. -- Scott M.</p>

                <p>&#128278 Paul, I had a great time working with you on this event!! We have 
                    received nothing but positive feedback from our clients and they were 
                    extremely impressed with your performance. In the six years I have been 
                    hosting these receptions, this is honestly the first time I have seen 
                    dancing at one! Please extend my appreciation to the entire band for 
                    their outstanding talent. I definitely will recommend your band to my 
                    friends in the future and I will be glad to be in your business reference. 
                    I look forward to having another opportunity to work with you again in the 
                    future and know that I have nothing but good things to say about the BHTM!! -- Autumn C.</p>
